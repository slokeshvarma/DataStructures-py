      1. Industrial Hygiene and Its Importance
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section1">
      <p><b>Definition:</b> Industrial hygiene is the science of protecting and enhancing the health and safety of people at work and in the surrounding community. It includes identifying potential hazards, assessing exposure, and implementing controls to minimize risks.</p>
      <p><b>Key Aspects:</b> It covers various factors like chemical, biological, physical, and ergonomic risks. Each of these can contribute to potential illnesses, injuries, or discomforts, making the identification of such hazards crucial to maintaining a safe work environment.</p>
      <p><b>Process:</b> Industrial hygienists conduct regular workplace assessments to spot risks, monitor air and surface samples, analyze exposure levels, and advise on best practices to prevent exposure.</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b> In a manufacturing facility, industrial hygienists may monitor levels of harmful substances in the air, such as dust or chemical fumes, to protect workers’ respiratory health. By setting up controls like ventilation or filtering systems, they reduce workers' exposure to these substances.</p>
      <p><b>Importance:</b> Effective industrial hygiene minimizes health risks, prevents long-term health complications, and enhances worker productivity and satisfaction by ensuring a safe and comfortable work environment. It also reduces the likelihood of workplace incidents and supports compliance with safety regulations.</p>

      2. Physiology of Work
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section2">
      <p><b>Explanation:</b> The physiology of work focuses on understanding how physical labor affects the body and the best ways to perform tasks to prevent strain, fatigue, and injuries. This understanding helps create a safe and efficient work environment.</p>
      <p><b>Muscular System:</b> Tasks involving lifting, pushing, or pulling heavily engage the muscular system. Understanding how to use muscles correctly can prevent strain, sprains, and musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
      <p><b>Cardiovascular System:</b> Physically demanding jobs affect heart rate and circulation. Designing work schedules and breaks helps workers avoid cardiovascular strain.</p>
      <p><b>Respiratory System:</b> Environments with airborne pollutants like dust or chemicals can strain respiratory function. Proper ventilation and protective equipment reduce respiratory system stress.</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b> In construction, workers might be trained on correct lifting techniques and provided with break schedules to reduce physical strain. Adequate training and PPE, like back support and masks, help maintain physical well-being on demanding sites.</p>
      <p><b>Benefits:</b> Understanding work physiology supports developing policies that ensure physically demanding tasks are manageable, reducing the risk of chronic health issues and improving overall worker performance and safety.</p>

      3. Ergonomics and Workplace Design
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section3">
      <p><b>Definition:</b> Ergonomics involves designing workstations, tools, and tasks that suit human abilities and limitations, minimizing discomfort and the risk of injuries.</p>
      <p><b>Importance:</b> Ergonomics improves efficiency and productivity by allowing workers to maintain proper posture and reduce unnecessary strain during tasks.</p>
      <p><b>Design Factors:</b> Ergonomic design considers aspects like desk height, screen distance, tool grip size, and seating posture. Proper design reduces strain on the body, especially for repetitive tasks.</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b> An ergonomic office workstation may include an adjustable chair and desk, a monitor positioned at eye level, and a keyboard that supports natural wrist posture. These adjustments reduce musculoskeletal strain and fatigue.</p>
      <p><b>Impact:</b> Ergonomic design reduces injury risk, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or back pain, and helps employees stay comfortable and focused, leading to higher productivity and job satisfaction.</p>
      <p><b>Long-Term Benefits:</b> Investing in ergonomic design minimizes workers’ compensation costs, reduces absenteeism due to injury, and fosters a culture of care for employee well-being.</p>

      4. Occupational Health
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section4">
      <p><b>Explanation:</b> Occupational health focuses on promoting and maintaining physical and mental health in the workplace. It involves policies and programs that safeguard workers’ well-being and monitor any potential health risks associated with their jobs.</p>
      <p><b>Preventive Measures:</b> Occupational health programs often include regular health checkups, vaccinations, stress management programs, and other resources to help workers maintain good health.</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b> In a factory setting, occupational health services might include annual physical exams, respiratory health screenings, and wellness programs focused on healthy lifestyle practices.</p>
      <p><b>Mental Health Support:</b> Occupational health also recognizes the importance of mental well-being, offering support for stress, anxiety, and other workplace-related mental health issues.</p>
      <p><b>Benefits:</b> By addressing health concerns early, occupational health programs reduce absenteeism, increase productivity, and create a supportive workplace environment.</p>
      <p><b>Compliance:</b> Many industries follow occupational health standards set by regulatory bodies, ensuring that health policies comply with legal requirements and safeguard employee well-being.</p>

      5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section5">
      <p><b>Definition:</b> Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) includes devices and garments designed to protect workers from workplace hazards such as chemicals, heavy machinery, and extreme temperatures.</p>
      <p><b>Types of PPE:</b> PPE varies by industry and can include helmets, gloves, goggles, earplugs, face shields, respirators, and safety footwear, each tailored to protect against specific risks.</p>
      <p><b>Proper Use:</b> Proper PPE use requires training, ensuring workers know how to wear and maintain their equipment. Poor usage can compromise protection.</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b> In a chemical lab, workers wear goggles to protect their eyes from splashes, gloves to prevent skin exposure, and lab coats to shield their clothing.</p>
      <p><b>Regulations:</b> Many industries have strict PPE regulations, often enforced by organizations like OSHA, which mandate the provision and use of PPE to protect workers.</p>
      <p><b>Importance:</b> PPE significantly reduces the risk of workplace injuries and illnesses, protecting workers from direct exposure to hazards and ensuring their safety and well-being.</p>
      <p><b>Maintenance:</b> Regular PPE checks and replacements are necessary, as worn or damaged equipment may not provide adequate protection, reinforcing the need for proper upkeep.</p>
