            <h2>1. Big-Oh Notation</h2>
            <p>
                Big-O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It provides an upper limit on the runtime of an algorithm as the input size grows. For example, linear search has O(n) complexity as it traverses the input once.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Example: O(n) linear complexity
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
            </code></pre>

            <h2>2. Comparative Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Comparative analysis involves comparing different algorithms based on time and space complexity. For example, binary search is more efficient than linear search for sorted arrays with a time complexity of O(log n).

            <h2>3. Recursion</h2>
            <p>
                Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of a problem. Recursive algorithms are often used in divide-and-conquer problems, such as quicksort or finding factorials.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Example: Factorial using recursion
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
            </code></pre>

            <h2>4. Analyzing Recursive Algorithms</h2>
            <p>
                Recursive algorithms are analyzed by identifying their recurrence relations and solving them using methods like the Master Theorem. The complexity depends on the depth and size of each recursive call.
