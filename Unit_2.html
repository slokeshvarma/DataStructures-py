      1. Safety in Machine Guarding
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section1">
      <p><b>Machine Guards:</b> Machine guards are physical barriers designed to protect workers from the moving parts of machinery, which may pose risks such as entanglement, shearing, crushing, or impact injuries.</p>
      <p><b>Types of Guards:</b> Include fixed guards, adjustable guards, self-adjusting guards, and interlocking guards, each tailored to specific hazards and machinery types.</p>
      <p><b>Importance:</b> Guards ensure that operators avoid dangerous parts and are essential in industries with high levels of automation and machinery.</p>
      <p><b>Maintenance of Guards:</b> Regular inspections and maintenance of guards are required to ensure they remain effective and do not become hazards themselves.</p>

      2. Safety in Material Handling
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section2">
      <p><b>Manual Handling:</b> Refers to lifting, carrying, and moving materials manually. Proper techniques and ergonomics are essential to reduce risks of musculoskeletal injuries.</p>
      <p><b>Mechanical Handling:</b> Involves the use of equipment like forklifts, cranes, and conveyor belts to handle materials, which reduces physical strain but introduces mechanical hazards.</p>
      <p><b>Risk Factors:</b> Include repetitive motion, awkward postures, and lifting heavy loads. These can be minimized through ergonomic training and use of appropriate handling equipment.</p>
      <p><b>Safety Measures:</b> Ensure that equipment is regularly maintained and operators are trained in its safe use to prevent accidents.</p>

      3. Working at Different Levels
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section3">
      <p><b>Definition:</b> Refers to tasks conducted at heights or below ground level, where there are risks of falls or confined space hazards.</p>
      <p><b>Safety Equipment:</b> Includes harnesses, guardrails, ladders, and scaffolding, which are essential to ensure safe access and stability at different work levels.</p>
      <p><b>Training:</b> Workers must be trained on the proper use of safety equipment and emergency procedures in case of falls or entrapment.</p>
      <p><b>Regulations:</b> Safety standards mandate inspections and adherence to height and space safety protocols to reduce the risks associated with multi-level work.</p>

      4. Good Housekeeping, Lighting, and Color
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section4">
      <p><b>Good Housekeeping:</b> Involves keeping the workplace organized and clean to prevent hazards such as slips, trips, and falls. This includes regular waste disposal, proper storage, and clear walkways.</p>
      <p><b>Lighting:</b> Proper lighting is essential to avoid accidents caused by poor visibility. Work areas should be well-lit, and lighting should be maintained to prevent shadows or glare.</p>
      <p><b>Color Coding:</b> Colors are used to indicate hazards and safety zones. For example, red often indicates danger zones, while green shows safe areas or exits.</p>
      <p><b>Impact on Safety:</b> Together, good housekeeping, appropriate lighting, and color coding reduce accidents and promote a safer, more efficient work environment.</p>

      5. Ventilation and Heat Control
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section5">
      <p><b>Ventilation:</b> Ensures fresh air circulation and removes contaminants from the workspace, reducing the risk of respiratory issues and chemical exposure.</p>
      <p><b>Types of Ventilation:</b> General ventilation provides fresh air throughout the facility, while local exhaust ventilation removes pollutants at the source.</p>
      <p><b>Heat Control:</b> Managing temperature is essential, especially in areas where machinery generates excessive heat, as it can lead to heat stress and reduced worker efficiency.</p>
      <p><b>Safety Standards:</b> OSHA and other regulations provide guidelines for ventilation and temperature to maintain a safe and comfortable work environment.</p>

      6. Electrical Safety
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section6">
      <p><b>Hazards:</b> Electrical safety addresses risks like electric shocks, burns, and fires that can occur due to faulty wiring or improper handling of electrical equipment.</p>
      <p><b>Precautions:</b> Proper grounding, insulation, and regular inspection of electrical equipment are essential to prevent accidents.</p>
      <p><b>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):</b> Insulated gloves, rubber mats, and protective eyewear can reduce exposure to electrical hazards.</p>
      <p><b>Lockout/Tagout (LOTO):</b> Procedures are essential for safely shutting down electrical systems during maintenance or repair to prevent accidental energization.</p>

      7. Noise and Vibration
    </div>
    <div class="section-content" id="section7">
      <p><b>Noise:</b> Excessive noise in the workplace can lead to hearing loss and increased stress. Sound levels should be monitored and kept within safe limits.</p>
      <p><b>Vibration:</b> Prolonged exposure to vibration, especially from hand-held tools, can lead to hand-arm vibration syndrome and other musculoskeletal issues.</p>
      <p><b>Controls:</b> Use of quieter machinery, noise barriers, and personal protective equipment like earplugs and earmuffs can reduce the risks associated with noise.</p>
      <p><b>Regulations:</b> OSHA and other organizations set exposure limits and guidelines for managing noise and vibration in workplaces.</p>
